## Core Workflow

1. User logs into the application.
2. The system retrieves current cryptocurrency market data.
3. The user searches for an asset or selects one from the watchlist.
4. The application displays price information and interactive charts.
5. The user can perform a simulated Buy or Sell transaction.
6. The transaction is recorded in the database.
7. The user's virtual balance and holdings are updated.
8. Portfolio value and profit/loss are recalculated.
9. Transaction history is maintained for future analysis.

## Security and Risk Considerations

The project considers several potential risks:

* Market-data API failures or rate limits
* Network and connectivity problems
* Delayed or inaccurate market data
* Real-time synchronization issues
* Database errors
* Authentication and security vulnerabilities
* Limited development time

The system is designed as a paper-trading platform and does not execute real financial transactions.
